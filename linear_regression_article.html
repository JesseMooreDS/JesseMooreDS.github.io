        <section>
            <p>Linear regression is a widely used statistical technique for analyzing relationships between variables. In simple linear regression, we model the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and an independent variable (X) using a straight line. The basic idea is that as the independent variable changes, the dependent variable is expected to change in a predictable way.</p>

            <p>The linear relationship can be expressed mathematically as:</p>
            <pre><code>y = mx + c</code></pre>

            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>y</strong> is the dependent variable,</li>
                <li><strong>x</strong> is the independent variable,</li>
                <li><strong>m</strong> is the slope of the line,</li>
                <li><strong>c</strong> is the y-intercept.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The line produced by the regression is called the <strong>best-fit line</strong>, which minimizes the sum of squared differences (residuals) between the actual data points and the predicted values.</p>

            <p>Linear regression is a powerful tool and is used in a variety of fields, including sales forecasting, demand estimation, and evaluating the impact of factors like marketing expenditure. However, for linear regression to produce reliable results, the model must meet certain assumptions. In this post, we'll explore the assumptions of linear regression and explain the <strong>LINE test</strong> that helps validate them.</p>

            <h2>The LINE Test: What It Means and Why It’s Important</h2>
            <p>The <strong>LINE test</strong> is a mnemonic to remember the four key assumptions necessary for valid linear regression models:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>L – Linearity:</strong> The relationship between the independent and dependent variables must be linear.</li>
                <li><strong>I – Independence:</strong> The residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) should be independent of each other.</li>
                <li><strong>N – Normality:</strong> The residuals should follow a normal distribution.</li>
                <li><strong>E – Equal Variance:</strong> The residuals should have constant variance across all values of the independent variable (homoscedasticity).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If any of these assumptions are violated, the regression model’s results may be misleading or invalid. Therefore, it's essential to verify that these assumptions hold before drawing conclusions from your analysis.</p>

            <h2>Example: Analyzing the Effect of Marketing Budget on Sales</h2>
            <p>Let’s consider a real-world scenario where we analyze how the marketing budget affects sales. We have data on the marketing budget (our independent variable <strong>X</strong>) and the number of widgets sold (our dependent variable <strong>y</strong>).</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Import Libraries and Create Data</h3>
            <p>First, we'll import the necessary libraries and generate synthetic data for this analysis.</p>

            <pre><code>
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.stats.stattools import durbin_watson
from matplotlib.pyplot import style

style.use('dark_background')

# Create sample data
X = np.linspace(0, 300, 100)  # Independent variable: Marketing budget
y = (X * 2) + np.random.normal(0, 20, size=X.shape)  # Dependent variable: Widgets sold with noise
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Step 2: Visualize the Data</h3>
            <p>Before fitting the model, we’ll visualize the data to check for a linear trend.</p>

            <pre><code>
# Scatter plot of data
plt.scatter(X, y)
plt.xlabel('Marketing Budget')
plt.ylabel('Widgets Sold')
plt.show()
            </code></pre>

            <p>From the scatter plot, we observe an upward trend, suggesting that a linear regression model might be appropriate.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Fit the Linear Regression Model</h3>
            <p>Now we will use the <code>Statsmodels</code> library to fit a linear regression model to the data.</p>

            <pre><code>
# Add constant to the independent variable (for the intercept term)
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# Create and fit the OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) model
model = sm.OLS(y, X)
results = model.fit()

# Print model results
print(f'F-statistic: {results.fvalue}, F p-value: {results.f_pvalue}')
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Step 4: Analyze the Model</h3>
            <p>The <strong>F-statistic</strong> and <strong>p-value</strong> tell us whether the model is statistically significant. A p-value less than 0.05 suggests that the model is significant.</p>

            <pre><code>
# Check if the model is statistically significant
if results.f_pvalue < 0.05:
    print(f'Model is statistically significant with p-value: {results.f_pvalue}')
else:
    print(f'Model is not statistically significant with p-value: {results.f_pvalue}')
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Step 5: Visualizing the Best-Fit Line</h3>
            <p>Next, we can plot the best-fit line from our model.</p>

            <pre><code>
# Plot the scatter plot and regression line
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(X[:, 1], y, label='Widgets Sold')  # X[:, 1] excludes the constant added earlier
sm.graphics.abline_plot(model_results=results, color='red', label='Regression Line', ax=ax)
ax.legend()
plt.show()
            </code></pre>
        </section>

            <h2>The LINE Test: Verifying Model Assumptions</h2>
            <h3>1. Linearity</h3>
            <p>We’ve already visually inspected the data and observed a linear trend. To further confirm this, we'll plot the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values). If the residuals show no pattern, we can conclude that the linearity assumption holds.</p>

            <pre><code>
# Plot residuals
plt.scatter(results.fittedvalues, results.resid, alpha=0.6, label='Residuals')
plt.axhline(y=0, color='red', alpha=0.6, label='0 line')
plt.xlabel('Fitted Values')
plt.ylabel('Residuals')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
            </code></pre>

            <h3>2. Independence</h3>
            <p>The residuals should not be correlated with each other. We can test this using the <strong>Durbin-Watson statistic</strong>, which measures autocorrelation in the residuals.</p>

            <pre><code>
# Durbin-Watson test for independence
dw_stat = durbin_watson(results.resid)
print(f'Durbin-Watson statistic: {dw_stat}')
            </code></pre>

            <h3>3. Normality</h3>
            <p>For the normality assumption, the residuals should follow a normal distribution. We can check this by plotting a histogram and a kernel density estimate (KDE) of the residuals.</p>

            <pre><code>
# Plot histogram and KDE of residuals
plt.hist(results.resid, bins='auto', label='Residuals Distribution', alpha=0.5, density=True)
sns.kdeplot(results.resid, color='red', label='KDE of Residuals', linestyle='--')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
            </code></pre>

            <h3>4. Equal Variance (Homoscedasticity)</h3>
            <p>The residuals should have constant variance across all levels of the independent variable. To check this, we plot the residuals against the fitted values. If the spread of residuals remains roughly constant, the assumption is met.</p>

            <pre><code>
# Plot residuals vs fitted values
plt.scatter(results.fittedvalues, results.resid)
plt.axhline(y=0, color='blue', label='0-Line')
plt.xlabel('Fitted Values')
plt.ylabel('Residuals')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
            </code></pre>
        </section>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In this post, we've covered the basics of linear regression and discussed the importance of verifying the assumptions of the model using the <strong>LINE test</strong>. By checking for <strong>Linearity</strong>, <strong>Independence</strong>, <strong>Normality</strong>, and <strong>Equal Variance</strong>, we ensure that our model produces reliable results. This methodology is not only useful for analyzing marketing effectiveness but can also be applied to a wide range of analytical problems.</p>

            <p>Linear regression is a powerful tool for any data scientist’s toolkit, and ensuring the validity of its assumptions helps ensure the quality of your insights.</p>
